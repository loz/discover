This repo is me just messing about.

I'm interested in developing a BDD/TDD framework in ruby, from scratch, using BDD/TDD principles.  In essence a bootstrap.  I hope to gain some understanding of the inners of such process, and learn about how I might use tools like rspec differently going forward.

This code is not intended to be used relied on by anyone to do anything.  Have fun by all means, but if it all goes bang..
