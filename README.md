In this repository I am exploring TDD from the ground up.  How can I apply TDD without a TDD framework, and what would it look like to build a TDD/BDD framework when non exists (i.e. I don't use existing ones).

The main place for this is within the website: http://loz.github.com/discover/ where I am publishing articles written as I explore the work.

Each branch also contains code that I am writing inside the articles.

This code is not intended to be used relied on by anyone to do anything.  Have fun by all means, but if it all goes bang..
